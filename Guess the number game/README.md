[Blog: Step by Step Guide](https://theinsightfulcoder.com/how-to-build-a-guessing-number-game-using-python):
==========================
You can find a step by step walkthrough in my [Blog](https://theinsightfulcoder.com/how-to-build-a-guessing-number-game-using-python)

What will be covered in this Blog?
==========================
```
1. The Random Module
2. Basic concepts of Python: type casting, conditional statements, iterative statements and string interpolation
3. Implementation of the guessing the number game with detailed explanation
```
**Random module:**
==========================
[Random Module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) is a python library that generates random numbers. 
random.randint(a, b) returns a random integer N such that a <= N <= b. It is alias for randrange(a, b+1).

## What is Type Casting?
The conversion of one data type into another is known as type casting or type conversion.
## Basics of Python:

### Conditional Statement: if
If statement is a conditional statement that runs on the logic that if a certain condition is true, it will run the code inside the if block else it will run the other block. A simple implementation of the same is seen below:

```
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")

#output
b is greater than a
```
Try the above code [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_if2).

You can also have multiple if-else statements and also an if statement inside an if statement. This is known as the [Nested if- structure](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_conditions.asp).

### Iterative statement: for
A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).

```
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)

#output
apple
banana
cherry
```
## What is f-string or String Interpolation?
Interpolation or interpolate means insert (something of a different nature) into something else. That is inserting/replacing the value of the variables inside the statement of the string we are going to display.

```
#syntax for f-string or string interpolation
name = 'Ashish'
age = 20
print(f"Hello, My name is {name} and I'm {age} years old."

#output is generated as the value of variable replaced with contents of {}
Hello, My name is Ashish and I'm 20 years old.
```
