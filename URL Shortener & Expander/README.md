==========================
You can find a step by step walkthrough in my [Blog]()

What will be covered in this Blog?
==========================

```
1. What is a URL?
2. Understanding the URL structure
3. Why do we shorten or expand an URL?
4. Basics of Python: Conditional Statements, Type Casting, Functions
5. The Pyshorteners module
6. Implementation of the URL Shortener & Expander with detailed explanation
```
**Pyshorteners module:**
==========================
[Pyshorteners Module](https://pypi.org/project/pyshorteners/) is a python library to help you short and expand urls using the most famous URL Shorteners availables.

## Basics of Python:

## What is Type Casting?
The conversion of one data type into another is known as type casting or type conversion.

### Conditional Statement: if
If statement is a conditional statement that runs on the logic that if a certain condition is true, it will run the code inside the if block else it will run the other block. A simple implementation of the same is seen below:

```
a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")

#output
b is greater than a
```
Try the above code [here](https://www.w3schools.com/python/trypython.asp?filename=demo_if2).

## What is a Python Function?

In Python, a function is a group of related statements that performs a specific task.
Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks. As our program grows larger and larger, functions make it more organized and manageable.
Furthermore, it avoids repetition and makes the code reusable.

```
Syntax of a Python Function:

def function_name(parameters):
	statement(s)
```
